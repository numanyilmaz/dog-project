# Create a model that detects humans and dogs from a given image using Deep Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the Machine Learning Engineering nanodegree.


### Project Design
The project broke into separate steps. 

**Step 0:** Import Datasets
**Step 1:** Detect Humans
**Step 2:** Detect Dogs
**Step 3:** Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
**Step 4:** Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
**Step 5:** Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
**Step 6:** Write your Algorithm
**Step 7:** Test Your Algorithm

### Dataset
The dataset provided by Udacity has 133 total dog categories and there are 8351 total dog images.
